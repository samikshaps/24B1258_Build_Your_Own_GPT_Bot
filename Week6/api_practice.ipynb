            "These ideas balance feasibility (for a student project), fun factor, and potential learning outcomes.  They also allow for varying levels of complexity depending on the student's skill level.\n",

            "**1. AI-Powered Meme Generator:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Concept:**  Train a model (likely a transformer-based one like GPT-2 or a smaller variant) to generate captions for images, or even generate both images and captions based on a given theme or keyword.  This could be further enhanced by incorporating image recognition to classify the input image and tailor the meme accordingly.\n",
            "* **Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, image processing libraries (OpenCV, Pillow).  Pre-trained models could significantly reduce training time.\n",
            "* **Fun Factor:**  Memes are universally appealing, and seeing the AI's creative (and sometimes absurd) output can be highly entertaining.\n",

            "* **Tech Stack:** Python, libraries like librosa (audio analysis), spaCy/NLTK (natural language processing), scikit-learn (machine learning).  Utilize existing music APIs (Spotify, Last.fm) for data.\n",
            "* **Fun Factor:**  Directly applicable to a student's own music consumption habits; allows for experimentation with different algorithms and feature engineering.\n",

            "* **Fun Factor:**  Playing against your own creation and seeing how well it performs can be very rewarding.  Iterative improvement of the AI is inherently fun.\n",
