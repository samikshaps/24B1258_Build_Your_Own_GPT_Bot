Introduction
============
India has a complex legal system derived from its colonial past and influenced by its constitutional principles. The Indian legal system includes various statutes, regulations, and judicial precedents. The Constitution of India is the supreme law of the land and provides the framework for governance, rights, and duties.

Constitutional Framework
========================
The Constitution of India came into effect on January 26, 1950. It establishes India as a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic. The Constitution outlines the structure, powers, and functions of various organs of the government and guarantees fundamental rights to citizens.

Key features include:
- Separation of powers among Legislature, Executive, and Judiciary
- Federal structure with a strong central government
- Fundamental Rights and Duties
- Directive Principles of State Policy

Criminal Law
============
Indian criminal law is primarily governed by the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and the Indian Evidence Act.

- IPC defines offenses and prescribes punishments for them.
- CrPC provides the procedural framework for the administration of criminal justice.
- The Indian Evidence Act governs the admissibility of evidence in Indian courts.

Notable sections include:
- Section 302 IPC (Murder)
- Section 376 IPC (Rape)
- Section 420 IPC (Cheating)
